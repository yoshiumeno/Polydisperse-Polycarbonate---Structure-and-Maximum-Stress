# Polydisperse-Polycarbonate---Structure-and-Maximum-Stress
## Name of Dataset: Polydisperse Polycarbonate - Structure and Maximum Stress

## Description:
The data contains structural parameters of polydisperse polycarbonate—same number average molecular weight of 32.8 kg/mol with different weight average molecular weight—with its tensile maximum stress from coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation (a transverse-constrained tension condition) with a strain rate of 10^10 per second at 300 K temperature in Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS). The configurations were generated with the energy equilibrium strategy [1] with two crucial simulation parameters, which are segment length and annealing temperature. This data aims to be supporting data for publication. Please refer to the publication linked to this data for a detailed explanation.
The data has nine columns: index, pdi, ls, ta, sa, rg, rgn, ze, and sm.
index = index of row
pdi = polydispersity index
ls = segment length [monomer]
ta = annealing time [ns]
sa = sample number generated with different random seeds
rg = radius of gyration [Å]
rgn = radius of gyration normalized by square root of molecular weight [Å/(kg/mol)^(1/2)]
ze = number of entanglements per molecule computed by Z1-code [2]
sm = maximum stress from coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation [MPa]
